```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
results <- read.table("results.tsv", 
                      col.names = c("qseqid", "sseqid", "pident", "length", "mismatch", "gapopen", "qstart", "qend", "sstart", "send", "evalue", "bitscore"))
```

```{r}
hist(results$bitscore, breaks = 30)
```

There are a few hits with very high bitscores, but the rest of the bitscores seem to be centered around ~350 with another peak close to 0. 

```{r}
ggplot(results) + 
  aes(pident, bitscore) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
```

```{r}
ggplot(results) + 
  aes(pident * (qend - qstart), bitscore) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) + 
  geom_smooth()
```

Multiplying percent identity by alignment length reveals a strong relationship between scaled percent identity and bitscore.
