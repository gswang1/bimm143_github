## The PDB database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org) (PDB). It is the second oldest database (after GenBank). 

What is currently in the PDB?

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
head(stats)
```

### Question 1

What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
del_comma <- function(x){
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}

stats <- data.frame(apply(stats, 2, del_comma), row.names = rownames(stats))
```

```{r}
sum(stats$X.ray) / sum(stats$Total) * 100
sum(stats$EM) / sum(stats$Total) * 100
```

### Question 2

What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
sum(stats["Protein (only)", -ncol(stats)]) / sum(stats$Total) * 100
```

### Question 3

Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

## Visualizing with Mol-star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code `1HSG`. 

We will use [Mol-star](https://molstar.org/viewer).

## Using the `bio3d` package in R

The Bio3D package is focused on structural bioinformatics analysis and allows us to read and analyze PDB (and related) datasets. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1HSG")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

We can see atom data with `pdb$atom`. 

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdbseq(pdb))
```

## Molecular visualization in R

We can make a quick 3d visualization with the `view.pdb()` function. 

```{r}
#install.packages("pak")
#pak::pak("bioboot/bio3dview")
library(bio3dview)

#install.packages("NGLVieweR")
library(NGLVieweR)
```

```{r}
# view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "cyan", colorScheme = "sse") |>
#  setSpin()
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno = 25)

# view.pdb(pdb, 
#          highlight = sel, 
#          highlight.style = "spacefill", 
#          cols = c("green", "orange")) |> 
#   setRock()
```

## Predicting functional motions of a structure

We can finish off with a bioinformatics prediction of the functional motions of a protein. 

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA). 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)

plot(m)
```

```{r}
# view.nma(m)
```

We can write out a trajectory of the predicted dynamics and view this in Mol-star.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "nma.pdb")
```
